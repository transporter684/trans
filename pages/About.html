    <h1><b><u>ABOUT US</u></b></h1>
    <p>Transportation is a major contributor to the economy and a competitive force in business. It is the activity that physically connects the business to its supply chain partners, such as suppliers and customers, and is a major influence on the customer’s satisfaction with the company.</p>
    <p> It is an essential activity in the logistics function, supporting the economic utilities of place and time. Place utility infers that customers have product available where they demand it. Time utility suggests that customers have access to product when they demand it. By working in close collaboration with inventory planners, transportation professionals seek to ensure that the business has product available where and when customers seek it.</p>
    <p>Transportation is sometimes to blame for a company’s inability to properly serve customers. Late deliveries can be the source of service problems and complaints. Products might also incur damage while in transit, or warehouse workers might load the wrong items at a shipping location. Such over, short, or damaged (called OS&D) shipments can frustrate customers, too, leading to dissatisfaction and the decision to buy from a competitor for future purchases.

        However, when a company performs on time with complete and undamaged deliveries consistently, this can instill customer confidence and gain business for the company. When a company instills confidence in service performance, it can make customers more reluctant to succumb to competitors’ bids to steal business away through clever promotions and reduced prices.</p>
